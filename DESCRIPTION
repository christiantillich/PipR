Description: The joke in data science is that we study all kinds of sophisticated statistics and modeling techniques just to spend 80% of our time shaping data to fit into the model. PipR tries to help with that. You create a yaml file (a pipeline) with descriptions of the steps, data storage paths, transformation function names,and other options. pipe() will run that data pipeline for you. check() will apply lists of QA functions against the sets specified by your pipeline.
